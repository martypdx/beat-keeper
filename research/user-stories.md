## Little kid
As a little kid, I want to play music on the internet for free until Mom tells me to put the computer away.

## Mom
As a Mom, I want an outlet for my kid to play and learn about drum samples without having to pay somebody.

## Developer
As a developer, I want to create a fun, interactive outlet for Moms and kids so they can easily express themselves creatively.
